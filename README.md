# STYX
2d surface / 3d subsurface urban hydrological model

STYX is a dynamic and spatially distributed hydrological model with 2d surface and 3d subsurface water flow and solute transport descriptions.

Input files into the model can be created with the mesh builder Python script.

Initial version of the model developed in the EviBAN project in 2022.
